# 300 - Building Our Application

GitLab CI/CD is an essential tool that allows developers to automate their software delivery process. It offers various features that facilitate the entire process, from building and testing to deploying and monitoring. In this article, we will focus on GitLab CI/CD Releases with build.

To begin with, letâ€™s consider a minimal example of creating a new GitLab project that is inspired by [Home Assistant: Add-on "Hello World!"](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/home-assistant-add-on-hello-world/tree/main) and consists of six files: 

- README.md
- LICENSE
- Dockerfile
- config.yaml
- run.sh
- .gitlab-ci.yml. 

The objective of this project is to create a downloadable release.
